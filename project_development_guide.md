# ðŸ›  ZEN-LYF AI - Project Development Guide (No-Code Approach)

## âœ… Step 1: Web App & Landing Page (Bubble.io)
- Build responsive landing page (Apple-inspired, glass-morphic UI, Framer Motion)
- Embed demo videos (Apple Watch, Fitbit data demos)
- Sign-up/sign-in integrated with Firebase Authentication (Google/Apple)

## âœ… Step 2: Mobile App (Thunkable/Adalo)
- Set up user onboarding and dashboard
- Integrate wearable APIs (Apple HealthKit, Fitbit API, Google Fit API)
- Configure page for uploading medical reports to backend and triggering AI analysis

## âœ… Step 2: Authentication (Firebase)
- Setup Firebase authentication (Google, Apple, Email)
- Store user profiles and basic health data securely

## âœ… Step 3: Backend & Automation (Xano & Zapier)
- Configure Xano API endpoints for patient data and AI integration
- Automate medical report analysis using Hugging Face medical models via Zapier/Make.com
- Setup automated workflows for daily AI-driven patient check-ins

## âœ… Step 4: Wearable Integration (Thunkable/Adalo)
- Integrate wearable APIs to capture real-time health data
- Sync data to Firebase via Zapier automation

## âœ… Step 4: Medical Report Analysis (Hugging Face API)
- Enable users to upload medical reports (PDFs, images)
- Auto-send uploaded files to Hugging Face API, retrieving structured insights and plain-language summaries
- Save insights to Firebase for real-time user dashboards

## âœ… Step 5: AI Wellness & Exercise Coach (SORA API)
- Generate personalized exercise routine videos dynamically
- Enable video uploads from patients for AI-based posture analysis
- Automate feedback loops (form correction AI feedback)

## âœ… Step 5: Hospital Dashboard & HR AI Agent
- Configure hospital dashboards (Bubble.io pages)
- Integrate HR & PR AI chatbots (Landbot or similar tools) into dashboard for automating internal hospital tasks

## âœ… Step 5: Testing & Deployment
- Conduct thorough user testing with a small hospital cohort
- Deploy web landing page on Bubble.io
- Launch mobile app beta via TestFlight and Google Play Beta
