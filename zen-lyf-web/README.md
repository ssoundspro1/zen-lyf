# ZEN-LYF Web Application

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Overview

ZEN-LYF is an AI-powered health and wellness platform that integrates smart health tracking, post-op recovery care, emergency response, and longevity optimization. This repository contains the web application component of the ZEN-LYF ecosystem.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Health Tracking**: Real-time analysis of health data from wearables and medical devices
- **Smart Post-Op Recovery**: Automated follow-ups and recovery monitoring
- **Mental Wellness Monitoring**: AI-powered stress and anxiety detection
- **Wearables Integration**: Compatibility with Apple Watch, Fitbit, and other devices
- **Smart Home Integration**: Environmental monitoring for optimal health
- **Emergency Response**: Fall detection and health crisis alerts
- **Medical Report Analysis**: AI-powered interpretation of medical documents

## Enhanced Wearable Demo

The Wearable Demo page showcases ZEN-LYF's capabilities for real-time health monitoring:

- **Apple Watch Integration**: Track heart rate, HRV, calories, stand hours, sleep, and stress
- **Health Metrics**: Monitor blood sugar, oxygen levels, temperature, and more
- **Smart Home Environment**: View humidity, temperature, air quality, and particulate matter
- **Interactive Features**: Explore detailed historical data with time-range selection
- **Modern UI**: Elegant design with intuitive visualizations and responsive layout

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Technology Stack
