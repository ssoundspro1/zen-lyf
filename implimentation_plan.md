};

### Security Rules
const securityRules = `
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // User profiles - only accessible by the user themselves
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Health data - only accessible by the user themselves
    match /healthData/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                          request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Medical reports - accessible by user and shared doctors/hospitals
    match /medicalReports/{reportId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                          (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || 
                           resource.data.sharedWith.doctorId == request.auth.uid ||
                           resource.data.sharedWith.hospitalId == request.auth.uid);
    }
    
    // Medications - only accessible by the user themselves
    match /medications/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
                          request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
    
    // Emergency alerts - accessible by user and emergency contacts
    match /emergencyAlerts/{alertId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && 
                   (request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId || 
                    resource.data.notifiedContacts[request.auth.uid] == true);
      allow write: if request.auth != null && 
                    request.auth.uid == resource.data.userId;
    }
  }

## Repository Structure & Deployment Strategy

### Repository Structure Options

Let's analyze the pros and cons of different repository structures for your ZEN-LYF AI project:

#### Option 1: Monorepo Approach

**Structure:**
```
zen-lyf-core/                # Core monorepo with shared code
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                  # Shared UI components
│   ├── api-client/          # API client libraries
│   ├── data-models/         # Shared data models
│   └── utils/               # Shared utilities
└── docs/                    # Documentation

zen-lyf-web/                 # Web application repository
zen-lyf-mobile/              # Mobile application repository
zen-lyf-api/                 # Backend API repository
zen-lyf-infrastructure/      # Infrastructure as code
```

**Pros:**
- Single source of truth for all code
- Easier to share components, types, and business logic
- Simplified dependency management
- Coordinated versioning across platforms
- Easier to implement cross-platform features
- Simplified CI/CD pipeline configuration

**Cons:**
- Repository can become large and complex
- Slower CI/CD pipelines due to larger codebase
- Potential for merge conflicts in shared areas
- May require more sophisticated tooling (Nx, Turborepo, etc.)

#### Option 2: Multi-Repo Approach

**Structure:**
```
zen-lyf-web/                 # Web application repository
zen-lyf-mobile/              # Mobile application repository
zen-lyf-api/                 # Backend API repository
zen-lyf-shared/              # Shared libraries (published as packages)
zen-lyf-infrastructure/      # Infrastructure as code
```

**Pros:**
- Clear separation of concerns
- Independent deployment cycles
- Smaller, more focused codebases
- Team specialization (mobile team, web team, etc.)
- Faster CI/CD pipelines for individual components
- Easier to manage access control per repository

**Cons:**
- Harder to share code between repositories
- Potential for duplication across repositories
- More complex dependency management
- Versioning challenges for shared components
- More overhead in managing multiple repositories

### Recommendation: Hybrid Approach

For ZEN-LYF AI, I recommend a **hybrid approach** that balances the benefits of both strategies:

```
zen-lyf-core/                # Core monorepo with shared code
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                  # Shared UI components
│   ├── api-client/          # API client libraries
│   ├── data-models/         # Shared data models
│   └── utils/               # Shared utilities
└── docs/                    # Documentation

zen-lyf-web/                 # Web application repository
zen-lyf-mobile/              # Mobile application repository
zen-lyf-api/                 # Backend API repository
zen-lyf-infrastructure/      # Infrastructure as code
```

**Why this approach:**

1. **Shared code efficiency**: The core repository contains all shared code, published as packages that other repositories can consume

2. **Independent deployment**: Each platform can be deployed independently, allowing for different release cycles

3. **Team specialization**: Teams can focus on their specific platforms while leveraging shared components

4. **Scalability**: This structure scales well as the project grows, allowing for more repositories as needed

5. **Reduced complexity**: Each repository has a clear, focused purpose

### Deployment Strategy

#### Infrastructure as Code

Use Terraform or AWS CDK to define your infrastructure:

```
zen-lyf-infrastructure/
├── environments/
│   ├── dev/
│   ├── staging/
│   └── production/
├── modules/
│   ├── firebase/
│   ├── api-gateway/
│   ├── cdn/
│   └── database/
└── scripts/
```

#### CI/CD Pipeline

For each repository, implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions:

1. **Web Application Pipeline**:
